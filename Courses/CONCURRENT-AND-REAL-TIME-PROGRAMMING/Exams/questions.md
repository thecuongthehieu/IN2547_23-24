Hi.. these are the questions..‚úåüèªÔ∏è

Questions about ex 1:
- What kind of transfer use to read from webcam (MA transfer?)?
- What does the function ioctl() do? Does it belong to the V4L library? (NO)

Questions about ex 2 (also related to ex 1):
- What is the reason to use the mmap function and it is not enough to pass the pointers directly?
- What are the functioning of mmap? What functions does it use?

Questions about ex 5:
- How do you check if task is schedulable?

Theory questions:
- Basic method to interact with the devices in Linux? (Poll)
- How interrupt are implemented?
- Tell something about cyclic executive scheduling?
- There can be more than one bus connected by bridges.. What do the bridges do?
- At what stage the bridges are configured (when you power up the pc)?
- Tell about task based scheduling?
- What are the condition for the optimal functioning of Rate Monotonic?
- What about sporadic task? (talk about it)
- Synchronization in Linux.. If we have a single core and we want to make sure that if a piece of code works on some data, no other code can concurrently work on the data, we disable the interrupt.. why? Why it does not work if we are in multi-core?
- When do you use TCP and when UDP?
- How response time analysis works?
- Tell something about Priority inversion and the technique that can be adopted to address this problem.
- Difference petween processes and threads (pros and cons, etc.).
- Speak about deadlocks (what are they, how to resolve, ..)
- Banker's algorithm.
- Describe the steps when a device throws an interrupt.
- Are interrupt efficient? Why they are not efficient for fast devices?


I think we have to bring our own HDMI to usb-c adaptor, because I don't see it now on the teacher's desk.. But the next time I will bring it, in case you need it..
