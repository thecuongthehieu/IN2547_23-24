## Lecture 7

- Critical instant theorem
- Note ri,j is the release time, but not necessarily same with the beginning time of execution
- Rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm (Proof of Optimality)

## Lab 9

- $@ in Makefile
- Deadlock src
- pthead\_lock and pthread\_cond
- Issue: wait() inside Critical Section

## Lecture 8
- Processor Utilization
- Response Time Analysis (The smallest solution is the actual worst-case)
- In RM, we are assuming that all the initial task jobs are released simultaneously at time 0 (Critical Instant)

## Lecture 9
- Sporadic task
- Minimum interarrival time
- Deadline Monotonic Priority Order
- How does Scheduler know the characteristics of tasks?
- " If critical regions cannot be nested " ?
- Priority Inheritance and Priority Ceiling Protocol

- What Realtime system means?
- VxWorks Realtime OS
- PREEMPT RT Linux patch 
- Spinlock

## Lab 11
- Linux to Linux-Realtime
- Mesured Delayed and Jitter
- \<sched.h\>
- What happens with concurrency inside kernels?
- NICE VS PRIORITY ( PR )
- Avoid memory swap (vmstat, panic_on_oom)
- Consider sched for final project

## Lab 12
- Thread CPU affinity
- Task activation pattern 
- Early Deadline First
- The deadline scheduler is optimal for periodic and sporadic tasks with deadlines less than or equal to
their periods on uniprocessor systems.
- The SCHED_DEADLINE in chrt
- chrt command in linux
- Rate Monotonic threshold of CPU utilization
- Can't run multiple scheduling policies in one core (the Kernel will apply CPU affinity!) What happen when run processes with chrt cmd
- echo $$ > cgroup.procs

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8063613/c-macs-os-x-semaphore-h-trouble-with-sem-open-and-sem-wait
	- Try putting sem\_unlink(""); before sem\_open(),
- https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696699/functions/sem_open.html 
	- If O\_EXCL is set and O\_CREAT is not set, the effect is undefined
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71765047/why-we-unlink-semaphores-before-we-initializes-them 
	- Because named semaphores such as are created by sem_open() have kernel persistence.
